## 📌 Abstract
Healthcare systems face growing challenges including clinician burnout, inefficient workflows, 
diagnostic complexity, and increasing administrative overhead. Generative Artificial Intelligence 
(GenAI), encompassing Large Language Models (LLMs), GANs, VAEs, and transformer-based architectures, 
has emerged as a transformative technology capable of addressing these issues.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of GenAI applications in healthcare, including clinical 
documentation, diagnostic assistance, appointment scheduling, medical imaging, drug discovery, 
personalized patient care, and biomedical text generation. While GenAI demonstrates significant 
benefits in efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, the study also highlights critical concerns 
related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, explainability, regulatory gaps, and ethical governance.

We conclude that GenAI can fundamentally transform healthcare delivery if deployed responsibly, 
with robust safeguards, transparency mechanisms, and interdisciplinary governance frameworks.
